  <h3>What We Hope</h3>
  <p>That we can develop computer vision to detect the presence of varroa mite.</p>
  <h3>What We Need</h3>
  <p>Your eyes! Help categorise the images &mdash; all you need to do is to be able to spot the difference between a picture that has a bee in it, and one that doesn't. Simple, right?</p>
